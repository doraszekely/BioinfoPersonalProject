# BioinfoPersonalProject
This is my repository for all the input, output files, report, etc..
My personal project for this course is going to be about reconstracting the phylogenetic tree of different Orca populations throught the world based on full mitochondrial genome sequences.

The outcome is a bit different to the original plan, this script is made for a test file with only a few sequences in order to present what the script would do to the mitochondrial genome datafile. 
The script let's the user decide whether a tree with each and every sequences are needed to be made or without the partial sequences.

!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!

In order to run the project_bioinfo.sh the treebuilder.py has to be edited and the command line inside that greps the txt file has to be set to the working directory that you use.

The input file is allseq_test.fas.
