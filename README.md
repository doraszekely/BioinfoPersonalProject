# BioinfoPersonalProject
This is my repository for all the input, output files, report, etc..
My personal project for this course is going to be about reconstructing the phylogenetic tree of different Orca populations throught the world based on full mitochondrial genome sequences.
In this data file I used there were some partial sequences but mainly full ones. The aim of the project was to compare trees made by all the sequences or without the partial ones.  
The project didn't really succeeded in the original workflow plans, but the script is made for a test file with a few sequences. 
This script runs the input file according to the user's decision, whether to create the phylogenetic tree from each sequence found in the file or without the partial sequences.

!!!!!!Important!!!!!!!!

Before running the project_bioinfo.sh script, you have to set the directory to your working directory in treebuilder.py in order to be able to grep the output file of the previous commands and turn it into a nice tree.
